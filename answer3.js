// Start
// End
// Timeout
// Promise 3 resolved
// Promise 1 resolved
// Promise 2 resolved

//First console.log statement prints "Start" in the console and “End” first.
//The setTimeout with 0 delay and promise3 with 0 delay are added to the event queue and executed after the call stack is empty, logging “Timeout” and “Promise 3 resolved”. promise1 and promise2 are resolved after their respective delays, logging “Promise 1 resolved” and “Promise 2 resolved”. The final output is: Start, End, Timeout, Promise 3 resolved, Promise 1 resolved, Promise 2 resolved.
